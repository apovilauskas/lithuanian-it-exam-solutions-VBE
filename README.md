# Lithuanian Informatics VBE Exam Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to all Informatics programming tasks from the Lithuanian National Maturity Exam (Valstybinis brandos egzaminas, VBE).

🗣 **Language:** Any comments are written in Lithuanian, as the original exam problems are also in Lithuanian.

## About the Project
Over the years, the Lithuanian Informatics VBE has included a wide variety of problems from short ones (about 30 lines long), to complex ones (including nested classes, 2d vector boards and 200+ lines of code).  
This repository includes my personal solutions to every publicly available exam task.

## Features
- Written in C++
- Covers all available exam years
- Focus on clarity and correctness
- Includes both simple and more complex tasks

## Purpose
The goal of this project was to:
- Prepare for the exam myself by creating a mock-exam environment (which was succesful, scored a 100)
- Build a comprehensive reference for students learning C++
- Preserve all national Informatics exam solutions in one place
